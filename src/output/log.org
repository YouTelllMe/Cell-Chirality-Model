- all optimization starts from (1,1) as p0
- models are bounded so that params >= 0


=========SYMMETRIC MODELS=========
### AB
- ab -> 0.12694053, 0.06384374

### Extending Models, Friction with EMS
- all extending spring models are fitted with e0 = 3/2, e1 = 1

- f: has linear pushback from egg -> 0.0078323 , 0.20483174
- nof: set f's A to 0 (no friction between cells, linear push back) -> 0, 0.20483174
- negf: set f's -A to 0 (friction direction is reversed; or "spin" is reversed) -> -0.0078323 , 0.20483174
- expof: using 1/x - 2 as expo func; this is multiplied by spring constant -> 0.01020005, 0.07363845
- expoconstf: using 1/x - 2 as expo func; this is multiplied by 0.0000001, not spring constant -> 0.03812974, 1.61594699
- vanderwaal: doesn't move from guess...

### Extending Models, Friction with Cell Wall instead of EMS


=========ASYMMETRIC MODELS=========
### ABp2
- p2 at 0 degrees -> 0.12524479, 0.02653989
- p2 at 30 degrees -> 0.09564888, 0.0260207
- p2 at 45 degress -> 0.08947309, 0.03101286

### Extending Models, Friction with EMS, p2
Not that great. Shell too small?
