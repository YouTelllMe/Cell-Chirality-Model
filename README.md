# Cell-Chirality-Visualization

Python Implementation of Cell Chirality Spring Model in early embryonic development of C. Elegans.

Notes: https://www.overleaf.com/read/xqqjsrdqwkcj

## TO-DO

1. Angle data doesn't have to be computed DURING euler steps, can decouple that process
2. Fix naming for Dorsal1, Dorsal Anterior...
3. Make sure the friction vector directions are correct. Something suspicious about the EMS friction.

## Note

- Cell 1 = Abar, Cell 2 = Abpr, Cell 3 = Abal, Cell 4 = Abpl
- positive z = top, positive x = posterior, positive y = right, right side spinning towards anterior?
